This is a solution to the producer consumer problem in operating systems
This is a demonstration of threads working with a mutex to make sure that they dont try to access the same resource at the same time
I use pthreads in c/c++ for the threads and mutex library for our mutex
First, we create a linked list that represents our queue that holds jobs
we have 2 producers and 2 consumers
The producers, one adds even nodes to the end of the linked list, and the other adds odd nodes to the linked list
The consumers, one deletes odd nodes and the other deletes even nodes from the linked list,
a consumer odd can only delete odd nodes from the beginning of the linked list, so if its even then it will stop and wait
The 4 producers and consumers can only access the linked list using the mutex
